# Peters Matching Pairs

### App deployed at [peters-matching-pairs.up.railway.app](https://peters-matching-pairs.up.railway.app/)

### // Project Description

My final project for Harvard CS50 course.  
I always loved memory games, and so decided to implement one of my favourites: The Matching Pairs!  
Players have to find all 15 pairs before the countdown ends. If they have an account, all found pairs and successful finished game will add points to their personal score. The ten highest scores appear on the leaderboard.
